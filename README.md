## The Cloud

Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.

**DevOps and the Cloud**

- Will make sure we use cloud to our advantage
	- Can expand if it is successful
	- Reduce if we don't get traction needed
	- All without committing large quantities of cash, possibly endangering other sections of the business
	- Shared responsiblity model: 
		- Amazon responsible for security of the cloud (mostly physical)
		- User is responsible for security inside your cloud and how it interacts with the outside

## Setting Up an Instance on EC2

**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud**

- EC2 eliminates need to invest in hardware up front, so businesses can develop and deploy applications faster
- EC2 can launch any number of virtual servers as needed, as well as security, networking, and storage configuration
- EC2 enables businesses to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing the need to forecast traffic

### Security Groups

A security group acts as a virtual firewall for an EC2 instance to control inbound and outbound traffic
